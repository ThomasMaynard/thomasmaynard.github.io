    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the mystery black box there is a cup filling up with water before dispensing the water at 500mL.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>My initial observation was that the black box was filling another container with the water before dispensing it. This is proven in our experiment since we replicated the trial of no water coming out and the trials of little more/less water coming out. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p> This is proven because when the cup is empty and 500 mL of water or less are poured in nothing comes out. When more than 500 mL of water the water comes pouring out which perfectly replicates the first trial of no water. The main thing in our model that doesnâ€™t match the black box was that the black box has a thicker tube but only a thin portion of water came out. With our model the water came out in more of a thicker portion.</p>
