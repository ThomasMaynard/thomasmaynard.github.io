    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the mystery black box there is a cup filling up with water before dispensing the water at 500ML.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>My initial observation was that the black box was filling another container with the water before dispensing it. This is proven in our experiment since we replicated the trail of no water coming out and the trials of little more/less water coming out. </p>
